# Mixin Pattern
Add functionality to objects or classes without inheritance. 
A mixin is an object that we can use in order to add reusable functionality to another object or class, without using inheritance. We can't use mixins on their own: their sole purpose is to add functionality to objects or classes without inheritance.
