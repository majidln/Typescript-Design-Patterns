# Factory Pattern
The **Factory Pattern** defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
 


By using abstract methods of a factory instead of the constructor to build instances, this allows subclasses to change what's built by implementing or overriding these methods.
